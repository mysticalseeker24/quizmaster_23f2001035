# Quiz Management System Modifications

## Overview

This document details the modifications made to the Quiz Management System to resolve issues with quiz score recording and display. The changes focus on improving the user experience by ensuring scores are properly calculated, stored, and displayed after quiz completion.

## Original Issues

1. **Quiz Scores Not Displaying**: Scores were not being properly displayed after quiz completion, particularly for Quiz 1.
2. **Missing User Information**: The user's full name was not being stored in the session, affecting the display on the scores page.
3. **Score History Not Maintained**: The system only kept one score record per quiz per user, overwriting previous attempts.

## Modifications Made

### 1. User Session Enhancement

**File Modified**: `app.py` (userlogin function)

**Changes**:
- Updated the userlogin function to store the user's full name in the session
- This information is needed by the scores template for proper display

**Technical Details**:
```python
session['fullname'] = user.full_name
```

### 2. Quiz Completion Flow Fix

**File Modified**: `app.py` (start_quiz function)

**Changes**:
- Added score calculation to the quiz completion flow
- Modified the function to call calculate_score when a quiz is completed
- Updated the redirect logic to ensure proper flow to the scores page

**Technical Details**:
- Added calculate_score(quiz_id) call at quiz completion
- Changed redirect to use url_for('scores') without parameters
- Improved flash messages for better user feedback

### 3. Score Calculation Implementation

**File Modified**: `app.py` (added calculate_score function)

**Changes**:
- Implemented a dedicated helper function to calculate quiz scores
- Ensured answers are properly matched with questions
- Added timestamp to score records

**Technical Details**:
```python
def calculate_score(quiz_id):
    # Gets all questions for the quiz
    # Retrieves user answers for this quiz
    # Calculates correct answers by comparing user selections with correct options
    # Creates/updates score record with timestamp
```

### 4. Score History Enhancement

**File Modified**: `app.py` (Score model and calculate_score function)

**Changes**:
- Removed the unique constraint from the Score model
- Modified calculate_score to always create a new score record
- This allows maintaining a complete history of quiz attempts

**Technical Details**:
- Removed `__table_args__ = (db.UniqueConstraint('user_id', 'quiz_id', name='unique_user_quiz'),)` from Score model
- Changed score update logic to always create a new record

### 5. Scores Page Enhancement

**File Modified**: `app.py` (scores function)

**Changes**:
- Improved query to join Score and Quiz data
- Added sorting by timestamp (newest first)
- Enhanced data preparation for the template

**Technical Details**:
```python
user_scores = db.session.query(Score, Quiz)\
    .join(Quiz)\
    .filter(Score.user_id == user_id)\
    .order_by(Score.timestamp.desc())\
    .all()
```

### 6. Scores Template Update

**File Modified**: `templates/scores.html`

**Changes**:
- Updated template to work with the new data structure
- Improved the display of scores, showing score out of total questions
- Added percentage calculation

**Technical Details**:
```html
<td>{{ data.score.score }} out of {{ data.question_count }}</td>
<td>{{ data.percentage }}%</td>
```

### 7. Score Reset Functionality

**File Modified**: `app.py` (added reset_scores function)

**Changes**:
- Added a new route to handle resetting all scores for a user
- Implemented deletion of score records

**Technical Details**:
```python
@app.route('/reset_scores', methods=['POST'])
def reset_scores():
    # Delete all scores for the current user
    Score.query.filter_by(user_id=user_id).delete()
    db.session.commit()
```

**File Modified**: `templates/scores.html`

**Changes**:
- Added a "Reset All Scores" button
- Implemented confirmation dialog
- Added flash message display

**Technical Details**:
```html
<form action="{{ url_for('reset_scores') }}" method="POST" onsubmit="return confirm('Are you sure...')">
    <button type="submit" class="btn btn-danger">Reset All Scores</button>
</form>
```

## How to Test the Changes

1. **Login as a User**: Use any valid user credentials to log in
2. **Take a Quiz**: Navigate to any quiz and complete it
3. **View Scores**: After completion, you should be redirected to the scores page
4. **Verify Display**: Scores should show correctly with:
   - Quiz name
   - Score out of total questions
   - Percentage
   - Timestamp
5. **Take Multiple Attempts**: Take the same quiz multiple times to verify all attempts are recorded
6. **Test Reset**: Use the "Reset All Scores" button to clear your history

## Technical Notes

- The database schema has been modified (removed unique constraint on Score table)
- No database migration was required as SQLite handles this change gracefully
- The application maintains backward compatibility with existing data
- The user session now contains additional information (fullname)
- The UserAnswer table is used to store individual answers, but does not have a user_id column

## Future Improvements

- Add individual score deletion (rather than resetting all scores)
- Add quiz attempt details page to show which questions were answered correctly/incorrectly
- Implement user performance analytics over time
- Add export functionality for score history
